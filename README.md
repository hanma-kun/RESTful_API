# REST API using Gin

This project demonstrates a basic REST API implementation using the Gin framework in Go. It provides endpoints to manage albums.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.14 or higher)
- `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` package

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

### Usage

1. Run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on `localhost:8080`.

2. Access the endpoints using a tool like [curl](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or through a web browser:

- Get a list of albums: `GET http://localhost:8080/albums`
- Get an album by ID: `GET http://localhost:8080/albums/:id`
- Create a new album: `POST http://localhost:8080/albums`
