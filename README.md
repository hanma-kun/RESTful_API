# REST API using Gin

This project demonstrates a basic REST API implementation using the Gin framework in Go. It provides endpoints to manage albums.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.14 or higher)
- `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` package

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
Usage
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
The server will start on localhost:8080.

Access the endpoints using a tool like curl or Postman or through a web browser:
